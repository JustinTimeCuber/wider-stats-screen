# Wider Stats Screen

Makes the items section of the Minecraft stats screen more spread out, so that more digits can be seen without overlap. Currently available for 1.19.x. Might not work on all display resolutions and GUI scale settings; if you have issues with the sides of the menu being cut off then try decreasing your GUI scale. This will be worked on more in the future.
