# Wider Stats Screen

This mod spreads the columns in the "Items" section of the statistics menu farther from each other than in vanilla. This fixes the issue where having more than a million of some statistic would cause it to overlap with the column to its left. The width is configurable by editing the file `.minecraft/config/wider-stats-screen.txt`, so if it overflows on the sides of your screen, try decreasing that value or decreasing your GUI scale.
